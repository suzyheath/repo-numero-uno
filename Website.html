<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the 
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

<ol>
<li>HTML is cool</li>
<li>CSS is cooler</li>
<li>JS is the best</li>
</ol>

<h2>What do you need to create a website?</h2>

<h3>Not much!</h3>
<ul>
<li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
<li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
<li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
<li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
</ul>
